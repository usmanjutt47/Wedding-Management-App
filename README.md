This project is built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) using [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the app:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the App**  
   Launch the app using:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   You can open the app in one of the following environments:

   - [Development Build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) (a sandbox for quick app development)

Start developing by editing files in the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Resetting the Project

To start fresh, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory for development.
